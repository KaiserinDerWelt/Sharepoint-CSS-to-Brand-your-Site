/* This gonna look so silly but in SharePoint there are CSS properties that does not work like in a regular text editor and html/css file*/
/*To align a component right in the center of the container use the following code implementing CSS Flexbox properties*/
/*Remember to use the !important property to OVER WRITTE the Core15.css file, it gonna save you a lot of time*/
      
      
    .YourClass  {
    display: flex !important;
    align-items: center !important;
    justify-content: center !important;
    }


Old school option:

.YourClassHere {
  align-self: center;
}
