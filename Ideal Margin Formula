Margin value as percentage = desired margin in pixels / width of containing element * 100

/*Example*/

MVP = 500/30*100


Margin is the CSS property that controls spacing between elements and can be set in pixels, em/rem, or percentages. 

Multiple values for margins can be set by changing TRBL (top, right, bottom, left) margins. 

Default space between elements is set by the browser.

For block elements, when two vertical margins with different values touch, the margins don't accumulate. Instead, they collapse, and the largest value will be kept. This is called vertical margin collapse. 

To center elements, you can set margins to  auto  .
