/*I created a way to incorporate the beauty of the modern experience in a SharePoint 2013 scenario, it means you can brand your developmen
in sharepoint designer and add as a feature the visual characteristics of the Modern Experience (2016/2019)*/

/*YOUR OPTIONS: */

/*It is easier than you think*/

/* 1) Work using iframes by the sharepoint snippet generator BUT you will need an advanced knowledge of javascript to hide the components of the suite 
you do not wanna see!*/

/*Â¨2) Add an iframe in your html file and ciustomize by CSS files or/ and javascript */

 <iframe id="LibraryView"  width="1270" height="600" frameborder="0" src="https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite/YourPage/Forms/AllItems.aspx"></iframe>
